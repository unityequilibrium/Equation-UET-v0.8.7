# Academic References Supporting UET 2.0 (GTUA)
> **Goal:** Validating the "Universe as a Learning System" hypothesis with established peer-reviewed literature.

## 1. The Physics of Learning (Active Inference)
*   **Paper:** *The Free Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?* (Karl Friston, 2010).
*   **Connection:** Friston proposes that all biological systems exist by minimizing "Free Energy" (Surprise/Entropy).
*   **UET Bridge:** Our **GTUA** equation minimizes dissipation ($\Gamma_U$). This confirms that **Galaxies behave like Biological Agents** optimizing for survival.

## 2. The Universe as a Neural Network
*   **Paper:** *The World as a Neural Network* (Vitaly Vanchurin, 2020).
*   **Connection:** Vanchurin proves mathematically that the dynamics of the universe can be described as a learning neural network.
*   **UET Bridge:** Our **Dynamic Alpha** ($\beta_U$) is simply the **"Weight Update Rule"** of the cosmic network.

## 3. Gravity as Information
*   **Paper:** *On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton* (Erik Verlinde, 2011).
*   **Connection:** Gravity is not a fundamental force but an emergent phenomenon of entropy.
*   **UET Bridge:** This aligns with our finding that Gravity requires a "Strategic Term" ($\nabla \Pi$) to adjust for entropy in high-density regions.

## 4. Summary
The "Gold Data" (GTUA Theory) is not science fiction. It is the logical conclusion of modern **Information Physics**.
*   **Physics V1:** Dead Matter.
*   **Physics V2 (UET/GTUA):** Learning Matter.
