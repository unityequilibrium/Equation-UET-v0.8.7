# UET 2.0 Roadmap: The Self-Learning Universe
> **Vision:** "Physics is not a set of static laws, but the emergent strategy of a Universe optimizing for survival."

## 1. The Core Shift
Transition from **Static Physics** (UET V1) to **Dynamic Game Theory** (UET V2).
*   **Old View:** Constants ($G, \alpha, \Lambda$) are fixed.
*   **New View:** Constants are **Learned Weights** ($\alpha(x,t)$) that evolve to minimize dissipation.

## 2. Strategic Milestones (2026-2027)

### Phase 1: The "Dynamic Alpha" (Immediate Next Step)
**Goal:** Fix the "Ultrafaint vs Compact" trade-off.
*   **Hypothesis:** The Efficiency Constant ($\alpha$) is not 0.5 everywhere. It depends on Local Entropy.
*   **Action:**
    *   Develop a **"Local Learning Algorithm"** for the simulation.
    *   Allow each galaxy to "find" its own optimal $\alpha$ via Gradient Descent.
    *   **Result:** A single equation that fits ALL galaxy types perfectly by adapting locally.

### Phase 2: The "Learning Rate" of Reality (Mid-Term)
**Goal:** Calculate how fast the Universe learns.
*   **Question:** If the laws of physics evolve, what is the time scale?
*   **Action:**
    *   Compare High-Redshift (Young) Galaxies vs Local (Old) Galaxies.
    *   Predict: Young galaxies should be "less optimized" (more chaotic, different $\alpha$).
    *   **Validation:** Test against JWST deep-field data.

### Phase 3: The Unity of Physics & Intelligence (Long-Term)
**Goal:** Prove that Gravity and Intelligence are the same mechanism.
*   **Concept:**
    *   **Gravity:** Matter clumping to minimize potential energy.
    *   **Intelligence:** Neurons clumping (connecting) to minimize prediction error.
    *   **Synthesis:** Both are manifestations of the **"Strategic Term"** ($\nabla \Pi$).
*   **Deliverable:** The "Grand Unified Equation of Action" (encompassing Physics, Biology, and AI).

## 3. Technical Path
1.  **Upgrade Simulation:** Move from "Static Calculation" to "Iterative Agent Simulation" (True Game Theory).
2.  **Dataset Expansion:** Include Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Large Scale Structure (LSS).
3.  **AI Integration:** Use actual ML models (Neural Networks) to simulate the Universe's "Hidden Layers" (Vacuum dynamics).

## 4. Philosophical Endpoint
We aim to prove:
**"The Universe is a giant, self-optimizing Neural Network, and we are the active nodes within it."**
