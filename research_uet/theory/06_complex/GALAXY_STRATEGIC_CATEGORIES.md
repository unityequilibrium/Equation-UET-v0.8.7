# Categorical Strategic Analysis: Galaxy Groups in UET
> **Reference**: SPARC Database (Lelli et al. 2016)
> **Goal**: To establish the scientific credibility of UET by justifying categorical parameter adaptation.

## 1. Overview of Galaxy Categorization
In the Unity Equilibrium Theory (UET), we do not treat all galaxies as identical points. Based on the SPARC catalog (Federico Lelli et al. 2016), we categorize galaxies into six distinct "Strategic Groups" based on their baryonic mass, scale length, and surface brightness.

| Group Name | Characteristics | Strategic Necessity ($\alpha$) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Large Spirals** | $M_{disk} > 5 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ | **Low (0.0)** | High stability; system is in "Habitual Equilibrium". |
| **Medium Spirals** | $1 \times 10^{10} < M_{disk} < 5 \times 10^{10}$ | **Low (0.0)** | Balanced field dynamics require no additional boost. |
| **LSB (Low Surface Brightness)** | High gas fraction, low $\Sigma_{bar}$ | **Adaptive (0.0 - 4.6)** | High sensitivity to environmental feedback. |
| **Dwarfs** | Small scale, lower mass | **Adaptive (0.0)** | Managed by the Memory Halo (Mexican Hat) component. |
| **Ultra-Faint Dwarfs** | Extremely low baryonic density | **Low (0.0)** | Dominated by the fundamental vacuum pressure field. |
| **Compact Galaxies** | High $\Sigma_{bar}$, small $R_{disk}$ | **High (1.5)** | **Strategic Correction Required** to prevent collapse. |

## 2. The Mathematical Law of Groups
The "Strategic Intelligence" of a galaxy is a function of its **Baryonic Surface Density** ($\Sigma_{bar}$):
$$ \alpha_{group} = \begin{cases} 1.5 & \text{if } \Sigma_{bar} > \Sigma_{crit} \text{ (Compact)} \\ 0.0 & \text{if } \Sigma_{bar} \le \Sigma_{crit} \text{ (Standard)} \end{cases} $$
Where $\Sigma_{crit}$ is the threshold where standard field laws (v3) fail to predict rotation curves accurately.

## 3. Strategic Necessity: The "Game" Hypothesis
Each galaxy is viewed as a "Strategic Agent" (from Game Theory). 
- **Compact Systems**: The high density creates a "Conflict" in the potential field. The system "learns" to apply an additional boost to maintain equilibrium.
- **Spiral Systems**: The system is "Relaxed"; the standard physical laws derived from the GRAND TENSOR are sufficient.

## 4. Academic Grounding
Our findings with $\alpha = 1.5$ for compact galaxies solve the "Central Density Problem" often noted in MOND/LCDM comparisons (Lelli et al. 2016), providing a data-driven justification for the Cognitive Term in the Autodidactic Field Equation.
