# Phase CVII: Multi-Layered Kinematics (MLK)
> **Status**: Synthesized from User Feedback & Gold Data
> **Core Concept**: The stratification of motion. Distinguishing between deterministic (Newtonian) and intentional (Gradient) layers of reality.

## I. The Stratified Velocity Equation ($v_{total}$)
Movement in a learning multiverse is not a single-layer phenomenon. It is a superposition of two distinct physical forces:

$$ \vec{v}_{total} = \vec{v}_{Newton} + \eta_A \vec{v}_{Gradient} $$

Where:
- $\vec{v}_{Newton}$: Classical motion governed by the standard gravitational potential ($\nabla \Phi$).
- $\vec{v}_{Gradient}$: Information-driven motion (Active Inference), where systems move toward regions of higher "Awareness Density" ($|U|$).
- $\eta_A$: The **Action Coefficient** (Learning Rate of the local manifold).

## II. The Newtonian Layer (The Habitual Path)
At low awareness levels ($|U| \to 0$), reality defaults to classical mechanics. This is the "Habitual Strategy" observed in large, stable spiral galaxies:

$$ m \vec{a} = -\nabla \Phi_{Newton} $$

In this layer, the universe behaves predictably, following the path of least resistance in the geometric manifold.

## III. The Gradient Layer (The Intentional Path)
In systems with high Strategic Necessity (Dwarfs, LSBs, or biological life), the **Gradient Layer** dominates. Movement follows the gradient of the payoff field ($\Pi_{game}$):

$$ \vec{v}_{Gradient} = \kappa_G \vec{\nabla} \ln |U| $$

**Derivation of $\kappa_G$ (2026-01-02):**
From dimensional analysis: $[\kappa_G] = (km/s)^2 \cdot kpc = G \cdot M \cdot R$

For galaxy rotation, $\kappa_G$ represents the I-field (Information Field) coupling:
$$ \kappa_G = G \cdot M_{I} \cdot R_{scale} $$
Where $M_I$ is the equivalent "dark matter" mass from Information thermodynamics.

This is mathematically equivalent to **Gradient Descent/Ascent** in a Large Language Model (LLM). The system "chooses" paths that maximize information efficiency and minimize surprisal (Friston FEP).

## IV. The Action Tensor ($\mathcal{A}_{\mu\nu}$)
To unify these layers, we introduce the **Action Tensor**, which links intention to kinetic manifestation:

$$ \mathcal{A}_{\mu\nu} = \xi_L (U_{\mu\rho} \dot{M}_{\nu\rho}) + \zeta_L g_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{L}_{action} $$

- $\xi_L$: Action-Selection sensitivity.
- $\dot{M}_{\nu\rho}$: The rate of change of the Morphogenetic Field.

## V. Conceptual Interpretation
- **LLM Parallels**: Action in history (or physics) is like "Token Prediction" in an LLM. The universe predicts the next state of motion by optimizing its internal weights (Constants).
- **Multi-Layering**: Newtonian physics provides the "Canvas" (Substrate), while Gradient physics provides the "Stroke" (Intent).
- **Synergy**: Complex systems (like galaxies or life) exist at the intersection where Newtonian stability and Information-Gradient agility are perfectly balanced.
