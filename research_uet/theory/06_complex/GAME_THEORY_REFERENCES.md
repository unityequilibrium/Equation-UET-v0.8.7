## 1. The Autodidactic Universe & Neural Network Physics
- **Vitaly Vanchurin, Stephon Alexander, Lee Smolin, et al.** ([arXiv:2104.03902](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03902.pdf), [arXiv:2008.01540](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01540.pdf))
    - **Core Principle**: The universe learns its own physical laws through an optimization process equivalent to a Deep Recurrent Neural Network. Matrix models describe the landscape of laws where N → ∞ limits yield Yang-Mills gauge theories.
    - **UET Mapping**: The Awareness Tensor $U_{\mu\nu}$ acts as the "trainable weight matrix" of the cosmic network. Our field equations ($R_{\mu\nu} \propto U_{\mu\nu}$) mirror Vanchurin's derivation where General Relativity (GR) emerges from the entropy production of learning dynamics.
    - **Key Detail**: Quantum mechanics emerges near equilibrium (Madelung equations), while GR emerges further from equilibrium as the network builds spacetime geometry.

## 2. Bayesian Mechanics & The Free Energy Principle (FEP)
- **Karl Friston et al.** ([arXiv:2112.15242](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.15242.pdf))
    - **Core Principle**: Generic physical systems minimize "surprisal" (Bayesian prediction error) via Active Inference. This process is asymptotically equivalent to the Principle of Unitarity in quantum systems.
    - **UET Mapping**: The Multiversal Feedback Tensor $M_{\mu\nu}$ (Phase CII) is the realization of the FEP at a cosmological scale. Universes minimize a collective Free Energy ($F_{multi}$) to reach Meta-Unified Multiversal Equilibrium (MUME). Markov blankets define the boundaries between coupled universes.

## 3. Cosmological Natural Selection (CNS)
- **Lee Smolin** ([arXiv:hep-th/0612185](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0612185.pdf))
    - **Core Principle**: Universes reproduce through black hole "bounces," passing on fundamental constants (with slight variations) to offspring universes. This evolutionary mechanism explains the fine-tuning of natural constants.
    - **UET Mapping**: Phase CII's "Law of Genesis" captures this evolutionary logic. UET adds the "Strategic Necessity" layer: Child universes inherit "Strategic Alphas" ($\alpha$) optimized over generations to favor stability.
