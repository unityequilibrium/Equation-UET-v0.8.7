# Phase CII: Recursive Multiversal Genesis (RMG)
> **Status**: Synthesized from Gold Data (v0.3)
> **Core Concept**: The Universe as a recursive feedback network of multiple learning nodes (Universes).

## I. The Multiversal Feedback Tensor ($M_{\mu\nu}$)
In Phase CII, we move beyond the single-universe Grand Tensor ($U_{\mu\nu}$) to a coupled system. The interaction between two universes $i$ and $j$ is mediated by the **Multiversal Feedback Tensor**:

$$ M_{\mu\nu}(i,j) = a_{ij} U_{\mu\nu}(i) + b_{ij} U_{\mu\nu}(j) + \gamma_{ij} (U_{\mu\rho}(i) U_{\nu\rho}(j)) $$

Where:
- $a_{ij}, b_{ij}$: Linear coupling constants.
- $\gamma_{ij}$: Non-linear "Cognitive Entanglement" term.

## II. The Multiversal Field Equation
Each universe $i$ within the multiverse manifold follows a modified Einstein field equation influenced by the collective state of the network:

$$ R_{\mu\nu}(i) - \frac{1}{2}R(i)g_{\mu\nu}(i) + \Lambda_i g_{\mu\nu}(i) = \kappa_{ij} M_{\mu\nu}(i,j) + \lambda_{ij} \partial_\mu \Theta_i \partial_\nu \Theta_j $$

## III. The Law of Genesis (Birth of New Universes)
A new universe $k$ is spawned when the localized feedback density exceeds a critical threshold:

$$ |M_{\mu\nu}(i,j)| \ge \rho_{crit} \implies \text{Genesis}(U_k) $$

The child universe inherits a combined "Cognitive DNA" from its parents:
$$ U_{\mu\nu}(k) = \sigma_{ik} U_{\mu\nu}(i) + \sigma_{jk} U_{\mu\nu}(j) + \delta_k g_{\mu\nu} $$

## IV. Evolution and Stability
The collective evolution of the multiversal system is governed by:

$$ \frac{D U_{\mu\nu}(i)}{D t} = - \Gamma_M U_{\mu\nu}(i) + \beta_M \sum_{j \neq i} M_{\mu\nu}(i,j) + \xi_M \nabla^2 U_{\mu\nu}(i) $$

Stability is achieved when the system reaches **Meta-Unified Multiversal Equilibrium (MUME)**:
$$ M_{\mu\nu}(i,j) \to 0 \implies U_{\mu\nu}(i) = U_{\mu\nu}(j) $$

## VI. Scientific Grounding & Academic Context
To ensure the RMG framework survives technical scrutiny, it is calibrated against the following established research areas:
- **Jacobson’s Thermodynamic Gravity**: Deriving Einstein’s equations from $\delta Q = T dS$. RMG extends this by treating the "Heat" as information exchange between universes.
- **Verlinde’s Entropic Gravity**: Gravity as an entropic force. RMG scales this to the Multiversal level where $M_{\mu\nu}$ acts as the entropic gradient.
- **The Autodidactic Universe (Vanchurin et al.)**: Physical laws as a neural network. RMG is the realization of Vanchurin’s model as a **Recursive Multiverse Network**.

## VII. Verification Targets (Real Data)
The success of Phase CII is measured by its ability to "evolve" fundamental constants toward their experimental values over generations:
- **Fine Structure Constant ($\alpha$)**: Aim for $\alpha \to \frac{1}{137.03599}$ (experimental) instead of the initial $1/109$ approximation.
- **Cosmological Coupling ($k$)**: Calibrate toward the $k \approx 3$ value observed in BH-Galaxy coupling research (Farrah et al. 2023).
- **Entropy Reduction**: Demonstrate $\frac{dS_{RMG}}{dt} < 0$ leading to a stable $\Omega$ distribution.
