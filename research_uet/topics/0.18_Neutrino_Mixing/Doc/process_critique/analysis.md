# Research Analysis: Address Rotation (Neutrino Mixing)
**Topic**: Critique of PMNS Matrix Parameters.
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Research Grade

## 1. Introduction: The Matrix
Why do Neutrinos mix with specific angles?
**Process Critique**: It is **Geometric Projection**.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: The 3D Grid
*   **0.7 Neutrino**: Recoil Residue.
*   **0.18 Mixing**: The Recoil Vector is rarely aligned perfectly with our Observational Axis (Time/Space).
*   **Rotation**: The PMNS Matrix describes the **Angle** between the "Creation Phase" (Flavor) and the "Propagation Phase" (Mass).
*   **Logic**: Recoil emitted by a W-boson (Weak) comes out at a specific 3D angle relative to the Grid. As it travels, we see this angle project onto different axes (Flavors).

## 3. Conclusion
Mixing is not magic; it is **Trigonometry** of Information Flow in 3D Space.
