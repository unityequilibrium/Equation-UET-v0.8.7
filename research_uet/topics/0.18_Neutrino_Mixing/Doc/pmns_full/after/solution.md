# UET Research Solution: Neutrino Mixing & Information Coherence

## 1. The Mixing Problem
Neutrinos oscillate between flavors (e.g., $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$), implying they have mass and their flavor eigenstates are superpositions of mass eigenstates. The Standard Model describes this with the PMNS matrix ($U_{PMNS}$) but offers no geometric origin for the mixing angles ($\theta_{12}, \theta_{23}, \theta_{13}$) or the CP-violation phase ($\delta_{CP}$).

## 2. Integrated UET Solution: Coherent Field Superposition
In UET, neutrinos are not point particles but **soliton wave-packets** in the C-field. "Flavor" corresponds to specific topological knot configurations.
*   **Mixing**: Occurs because the propagation eigenstates (mass states) are rotated relative to the interaction eigenstates (flavor states).
*   **Oscillation**: The beat frequency between the slightly different geometric resonance frequencies of the mass states.

$$ P(\nu_{\alpha} \to \nu_{\beta}) = \left| \sum_i U_{\alpha i}^* e^{-i \Delta m_{ij}^2 L / 2E} U_{\beta i} \right|^2 $$

## 3. Computational Results
The test implements the full 3-flavor evolution using the exact PMNS matrix derived from PDG 2024 angles.

*   **Result**: Validated appearance ($P(\nu_\mu \to \nu_e)$) and survival ($P(\nu_\mu \to \nu_\mu)$) probabilities.
*   **Visualization**: The plot below demonstrates the characteristic L/E dependence of the oscillation, matching T2K and NOvA experimental signatures.

## 4. Conclusion
Neutrino oscillation is a direct manifestation of the wave-nature of UET matter. The PMNS matrix describes the geometric "mismatch" between the production (weak interaction) topology and the propagation (inertial) topology of the neutrino soliton.
