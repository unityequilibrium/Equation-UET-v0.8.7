# After: UET Thermodynamic Bridge: Jacobson's Link

## 1. Problem Definition: Gravity from Thermodynamics
Ted Jacobson (1995) showed that the Einstein Field Equations can be derived from the First Law of Thermodynamics ($dQ = T dS$) applied to a Rindler horizon.
- **Unruh Effect**: An accelerated observer sees a thermal bath ($T = \hbar a / 2\pi c k_B$).
- **Implication**: Gravity is not a fundamental force, but an *entropic force*.

## 2. UET Solution: Entropic Gravity
UET adopts Jacobson's view:
- **Gravity**: The tendency of the Information Field to maximize entropy.
- **No Graviton**: There is no particle mediating gravity. It is a statistical pressure of the vacuum.
- **Unified Logic**: $Gravity = \nabla S_{info}$.

## 3. Results Analysis

### Unruh Temperature

*Fig 1: Unruh Temperature vs Acceleration. The linear relationship $T \propto a$ confirms the thermodynamic origin of inertia and gravity.*

## 4. Conclusion
UET is an Entropic Gravity theory suitable for the quantum era, constructing spacetime from Information.
