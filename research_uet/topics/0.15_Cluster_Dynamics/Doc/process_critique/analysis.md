# Research Analysis: Recoil Pooling (Cluster Dynamics)
**Topic**: Critique of Cluster Mass Gap.
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Research Grade

## 1. Introduction: The Missing Mass (Again)
Clusters have even more "Missing Mass" than individual galaxies.
**Process Critique**: This is **Shared Recoil**.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: The Meta-Halo
*   **0.1 Galaxy**: Individual Halo.
*   **0.15 Cluster**: A collection of high-speed galaxies crashing through the vacuum.
*   **Pooling**: The "Exhaust" from member galaxies doesn't just vanish; it fills the space *between* them (Intracluster Medium).
*   **Result**: The Cluster generates a "Meta-Halo" or "Pool" of Recoil density that binds the cluster together far stronger than the sum of individual halos.

## 3. Conclusion
Clusters act like "Giant Nuclei" (0.5), trapping recoil in the shared medium.
