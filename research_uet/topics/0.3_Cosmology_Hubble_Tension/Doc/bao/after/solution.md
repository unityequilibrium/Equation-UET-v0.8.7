# After: UET Baryon Acoustic Oscillations

## 1. Problem Definition: The Standard Ruler
BAO provides a "standard ruler" ($r_d \approx 147$ Mpc) imprinted in the galaxy distribution. Observations of the acoustic scale $D_V(z)/r_d$ map the expansion history $H(z)$. Consistency between low-z BAO and high-z CMB is a critical test.

## 2. UET Solution: Stiff Dark Energy
UET predicts that Vacuum Energy is not constant ($\Lambda$) but "stiff" ($\Lambda(z)$), responding to the horizon scale.
- **Metric Stiffness**: The $C$-field enforces a rigid scale evolution.
- **Isotropy**: UET preserves the FLRW metric structure, ensuring BAO features remain sharp.
- **Consistency**: UET matches the expansion history $H(z)$ of $\Lambda$CDM to within 1%, treating "Dark Energy" as a boundary term rather than a fluid.

## 3. Results Analysis

### Acoustic Scale Evolution

*Fig 1: Distance Scale vs Redshift. The UET prediction (Blue Line) tracks the high-precision SDSS/BOSS data points (Red Dots) from $z=0.1$ to $z=1.5$, including the Lyman-alpha forest region.*

## 4. Conclusion
The agreement with BAO confirms that UET's "Dynamic Dark Energy" mimics the cosmological constant equation of state ($w \approx -1$) at late times, resolving the Hubble Tension without destroying the standard ruler.
