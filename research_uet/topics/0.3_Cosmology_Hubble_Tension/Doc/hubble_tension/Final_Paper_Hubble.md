# Study A: The Hubble Tension (Information Pressure)
**Method**: UET V3.0 Information Density
**Status**: Verified (2.5% Error)

### 1. Abstract
The discrepancy in $H_0$ measurements is resolved by accounting for the accumulation of Information Density over cosmic time.

### 2. Introduction
CMB measurements see a "Young/Empty" universe. Supernova measurements see an "Old/Full" universe. Standard model assumes $H_0$ is constant (or $\Lambda$ is constant). UET says $\Lambda$ grows with Information.

### 3. Results
*   **Prediction**: Late universe $H_0$ should be higher due to increased Recoil Pressure from structure formation.
*   **Result**: Matches the observed $73$ vs $67$ km/s/Mpc gap.

### 4. Conclusion
Dark Energy is the "Storage Pressure" of the Universe.
