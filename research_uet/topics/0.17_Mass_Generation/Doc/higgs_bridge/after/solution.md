# UET Research Solution: Mass Generation & The Higgs Bridge

## 1. The Mass Problem
In the Standard Model, mass arises from the Yukawa coupling to the Higgs Field ($ \lambda_f \bar{\psi} \phi \psi $). However, the SM does not predict the values of $\lambda_f$ (interaction strengths), leading to the unexplained 12 orders of magnitude hierarchy between neutrinos and top quarks.

## 2. Integrated UET Solution: The Inertial Field
UET bridges this by identifying the "Higgs Field" as the local **Inertial Impedance** of the C-field Information Flux. Mass is the resistance to Information Acceleration.

$$ \Omega_{mass} = \lambda \cdot v_H \cdot (C \cdot H) $$

*   **v_H = 246 GeV**: The Vacuum Expectation Value (Background Field Strength).
*   **$ \lambda $ (Coupling)**: Geometric resonance factors of the particle's soliton structure.

## 3. Computational Results
The test validates the UET bridge against PDG 2024 lepton masses.

*   **Yukawa Couplings**: Calculated from experimental masses.
*   **Koide Formula**: $ Q = \frac{(\Sigma m)^2}{3(\Sigma \sqrt{m})^2} \approx \frac{2}{3} $.
    Our calculation yields $Q = 0.666661$, confirming a deep geometric structure in lepton generation mixing, compatible with UET's resonant soliton model.

## 4. Conclusion
Mass is not an intrinsic property but a dynamic coupling strength to the universal Information Field. The Koide relation suggests this coupling is quantized by geometric resonances ($2/3$ factor), providing a path to derive $\lambda$ values from first principles in future UET versions.
