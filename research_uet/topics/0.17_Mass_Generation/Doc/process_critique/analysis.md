# Research Analysis: Mass as Resistance (Mass Generation)
**Topic**: Critique of Intrinsic Mass.
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Research Grade

## 1. Introduction: What is Mass?
Standard Physics says Mass is a property given by the Higgs.
**Process Critique**: Mass is **Latency**.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: The Update Cost
*   **Massless (Photon)**: Updates instantly ($c$). No internal state to change.
*   **Massive (Proton)**: Has complex internal state.
*   **Mechanism**: To move a Proton, you must update its entire internal Information Structure.
*   **Resistance**: This update takes time/energy. This "Resistance to Update" is what we physically measure as **Inertia (Mass)**.

## 3. Conclusion
$E=mc^2$ essentially says: Energy = (Information Complexity) * (Processing Speed Limit)^2. Mass is the measure of how much information is "locked" in the object.
