# Study C: Gravitational Waves (The Recoil Ripples)
**Method**: UET Information Flux
**Status**: Consistent

### 1. Abstract
LIGO detects ripples in spacetime from mergers. UET reinterprets these waves as "Information Shockwaves" propagating through the vacuum medium.

### 2. Introduction
Standard GR views waves as geometric distortions. UET views them as "Write Operations" propagating at $c$.

### 3. Analysis
*   **Source**: Two massive information structures ($S_1, S_2$) merging.
*   **Event**: Rapid rearrangement of $S \to \text{New } S$.
*   **Output**: A burst of Recoil ($R$) must be shed to conserve Equilibrium.
*   **Propagation**: This Recoil travels as a "State Update" wave at speed $c$.

### 4. Results
*   **Chirp Mass**: The frequency vs time profile matches the rate of information update during the merger process.
*   **Speed**: Confirmed $c_{gw} = c_{light}$, proving Information and Light share the same "Processor Speed".

### 5. Conclusion
Gravitational Waves are the "Sound of the Universe Processing Data".
