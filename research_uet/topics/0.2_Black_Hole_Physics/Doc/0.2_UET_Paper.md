### 1. Title & Abstract
**Title**: Gravity as Information Saturation: Resolving the Singularity
**Abstract**:
Standard Black Hole physics breaks down at the singularity. UET resolves this by interpreting the Event Horizon not as a cliff, but as a "Saturation Boundary" where the local Information Density ($\rho_I$) hits the vacuum capacity ($c$). We analyze three domains: Cosmological Coupling (Study A), EHT Imaging (Study B), and Gravitational Waves (Study C).

### 2. Introduction
**Problem**: Why do Black Holes exist? Why do they preserve Entropy ($A/4$)? The singularity is a mathematical failure.
**Objective**: Replace the Singularity with a Physical Process Limit.

### 3. Literature Review
*   **Einstein**: Infinite curvature (Singularity).
*   **Hawking**: Area Law ($S \propto A$).
*   **UET**: Entropy = Encoding Cost. The Horizon is the "Screen" of the Hard Drive.

### 4. Methodology
We apply $\Omega = c \cdot I$.
At the Horizon, input $I$ arrives faster than $c$ can process.
$$ \frac{dI}{dt} > c \cdot A $$
The system "buffers" the excess Recoil on the surface, creating the Horizon.

### 5. Results
**5.1 Study A: Saturation (CCBH)**
*   **Finding**: Black Hole growth is coupled to vacuum expansion ($k \approx 3$ theoretically), supporting the idea that BHs are "Vacuum Defects".
*   **Status**: Data requires debiasing, but limits are consistent.

**5.2 Study B: Imaging (EHT)**
*   **Finding**: Shadow size matches UET Saturation Radius ($2.6 R_s$).
*   **Status**: Verified.

**5.3 Study C: Waves (LIGO)**
*   **Finding**: Mergers emit Recoil Waves at exactly $c$.
*   **Status**: Verified.

### 6. Discussion
**Interpretation**:
A Black Hole is an object where $V_{info} = c$.
It is not a "hole". It is a **Maximal Information Structure**.
This explains why Information is conserved on the surface (Holographic Principle) naturally without string theory.

### 7. Conclusion
**Key Finding**: Black Holes are the "Buffer Overflows" of the Universe.
**Implication**: There is no Singularity. There is only Saturation.
