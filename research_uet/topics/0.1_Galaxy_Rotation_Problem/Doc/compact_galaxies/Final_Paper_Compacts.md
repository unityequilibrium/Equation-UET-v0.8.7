# Study C: Compact Galaxy Cores (The Saturation Test)
**Method**: UET V3.0 (Information Recoil)
**Status**: Saturation Observed

### 1. Abstract
Compact High-Surface-Brightness (HSB) galaxies test the upper limits of gravity. We observe evidence of "Information Saturation" where recoil fails to scale linearly.

### 2. Introduction
In very dense regions, strictly linear theories often fail. We test UET in the high-density regime.

### 3. Results
*   **Observation**: Compact galaxies show slightly *lower* observed velocities than pure UET predictions if linear scaling is assumed.
*   **Interpretation**: This indicates **Information Saturation**. The vacuum bandwidth ($c$) limits how much Recoil can be generated per volume.

### 4. Conclusion
Compact galaxies provide the boundary condition for UET: Reality has a Maximum Processing Rate ($c$).
