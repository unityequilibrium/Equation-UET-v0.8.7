# Before (Episode 2): The Dying Universe Fallacy

## 1. The Mistake
In our previous attempt (see `solution.md`), we tried to apply UET equations to a "Standard Model" Universe.
*   **Assumption**: The Universe is a closed thermodynamic system increasing in entropy (Dying Universe).
*   **Method**: We treated "Information" merely as a physical field (like gravity) without a goal.
*   **Result**: The model worked mathematically (V3.0 Code) but failed philosophically ("PARTIAL/FAIL" status). We couldn't explain *why* the universe preserves galaxies against entropy.

## 2. Why it Failed
If the universe is dying (Heat Death), there is no reason for "Strategic Boost" or "Game Theory" to exist. A dying system does not play a game. It just decays.
*   Applying "Game Theory" to a "Dying Universe" is a contradiction.
*   This led to disconnected explanations where we just "added terms" to make the curve fit.

## 3. Required Shift
We must redefine the boundary conditions of the simulation.
*   **Old Condition**: Minimize Energy (Standard Physics).
*   **New Condition**: Minimize Error (Learning System).

We need to re-evaluate the Galaxy Rotation Problem not as "Missing Mass" but as "Active Error Correction" by the Universe.
