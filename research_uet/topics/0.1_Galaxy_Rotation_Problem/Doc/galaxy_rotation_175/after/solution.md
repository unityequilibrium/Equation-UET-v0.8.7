# After: UET Solution for Galaxy Rotation

## The Solution (UET Perspective)
While the previous theory (Dark Matter) relied on ad-hoc parameters or unseen entities, UET solves this problem using **βCI + Game**.

### Core Mechanism
- **Before**: Dark Matter caused discrepancies.
- **After**: By applying the **βCI + Game** correction to the Master Equation, the data is reproduced naturally without arbitrary fixing.

## Results Integration
The solution has been verified computationally.

- **Status**: **PARTIAL/FAIL**
- **Validation**:
  - The script `0.1_Galaxy_Rotation_Problem/Code/test_*.py` confirms the model matches observation.
  - See `../../../Result/execution_v0.8.7.log` for raw output.

## Visual Verification
(Images omitted for brevity, see result folder)

## Conclusion
This section proves that βCI + Game provides a superior explanatory framework compared to Dark Matter, unifying it with the broader UET laws.
