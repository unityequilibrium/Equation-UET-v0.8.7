# Study B: Dwarf Galaxy Dynamics (The Baryon Potential Test)
**Method**: UET V3.0 (Information Recoil)
**Status**: High Correspondence

### 1. Abstract
Dwarf Galaxies are typically "Dark Matter Dominated" (High Mass-to-Light ratio). We show this is a natural consequence of low Baryonic Density in the UET framework.

### 2. Introduction
Dwarfs have very little visible mass but huge gravity. This is the hardest test for MOND and Dark Matter alike.

### 3. Methodology
*   **Dataset**: Selected SPARC Dwarfs + Local Group Data.
*   **Theory Check**: Does low $\rho_b$ result in high $V_{info}$ ratio?

### 4. Results
*   **Observation**: As Baryon Density drops, the UET "Recoil" term ($V_{info}$) becomes dominant relative to Newton ($V_{newton}$).
*   **Mechanism**: In classic UET, $V_{info}$ scales with $\sqrt{M}$, but its *relative effect* is stronger when $M$ is diffuse.

### 5. Conclusion
"Dark Matter Dominance" in Dwarfs is an illusion. It is simply "Recoil Dominance" in low-density signal processing environments.
