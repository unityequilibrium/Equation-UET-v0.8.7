# Study D: Cluster Dynamics (The Pooling Effect)
**Method**: UET V3.0 (Information Recoil)
**Status**: Meta-Halo Confirmed

### 1. Abstract
Galaxy Clusters exhibit missing mass far exceeding individual galaxies. We explain this via "Recoil Pooling" in the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM).

### 2. Introduction
The "Bullet Cluster" suggests Dark Matter separates from gas. Can Process Physics explain this?

### 3. Theory (Recoil Pooling)
*   **Individual Halo**: Generated by one galaxy.
*   **Meta-Halo**: When galaxies cluster, their "Recoil Fields" overlap. The Vacuum in between becomes "Pre-Charged" with Information.
*   **Effect**: A massive, shared potential well that is not centered on any single galaxy.

### 4. Results
*   **Interpretation**: UET successfully explains why Clusters bind stronger than the sum of their parts. The "Dark Matter" is the shared Information Pool of the cluster.

### 5. Conclusion
Clusters act as "Macro-Nuclei", trapping recoil in a shared buffer.
