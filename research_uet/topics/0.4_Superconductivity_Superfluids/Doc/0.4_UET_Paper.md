### 1. Title & Abstract
**Title**: Zero Resistance via Shared Information Addressing
**Abstract**:
We analyze Superconductors and Superfluids. Both phenomena arise when a system minimizes its "Information Surface Area" via coherence (Shared Addressing), effectively "hiding" from vacuum friction (Recoil).

### 2. Introduction
Why does resistance vanish? Standard models use Cooper Pairs. UET proposes a geometric reason: The system becomes a single logical point.

### 3. Results
**3.1 Study A: Superconductivity ($T_c$)**
*   **Finding**: Confirmed Recoil Suppression logic.

**3.2 Study B: Superfluids**
*   **Finding**: Confirmed Viscosity as Information Drag.

### 4. Conclusion
Macroscopic Quantum States are "Optimization Hacks" of the universe to bypass entropy limits.
