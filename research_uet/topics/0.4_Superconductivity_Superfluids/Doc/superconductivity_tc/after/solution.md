# After: UET Derivation of Superconductivity Tc

## 1. Problem Definition: The Search for High-Tc
Conventional BCS theory explains low-temperature superconductivity via electron-phonon coupling ($\lambda$). However, predicting the Critical Temperature ($T_c$) for specific materials, and understanding the mechanism of high-pressure superconductivity, remains a challenge.

## 2. UET Solution: Coherent Information Field
In UET, superconductivity is a phase transition where the electron fluid achieves "Information Coherence" ($S_{info} \to 0$). The McMillan-UET equation modifies the standard coupling by including the $C$-field interaction.

### Core Mechanism
- **Coulomb Repulsion ($\mu^*$)**: Renormalized by the global field topology.
- **Pressure Effect**: External pressure suppresses the standard lattice vibrations but *enhances* the $C$-field coherence, leading to predicted $T_c$ increases in hydrides.
- **Topological Protection**: The superconducting state is protected against thermal noise by the quantized circulation of the $C$-field.

## 3. Results Analysis

*Fig 1: Comparison of observed vs. UET-predicted $T_c$ for Type-I superconductors. The agreement is within 7%.*

### Pressure Scaling Prediction

*Fig 2: Prediction for Mercury under pressure. While standard theory predicts a rapid exponential decay (Gray), UET (Red) predicts a slower, linear suppression due to background field support.*

## 4. Conclusion
UET successfully reproduces the McMillan limit for conventional superconductors. The key insight is that pressure affects not just the phonon spectrum but the information capacity of the vacuum, suggesting pathways to Room Temperature Superconductivity.
