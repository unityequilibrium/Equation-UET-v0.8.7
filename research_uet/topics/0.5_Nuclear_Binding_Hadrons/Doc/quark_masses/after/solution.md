# After: UET Quark Mass Generation

## 1. Problem Definition: The Hierarchy Problem
The Standard Model particles exhibit a vast, unexplained hierarchy of masses (from $u \approx 2.3$ MeV to $t \approx 173$ GeV). The Higgs mechanism accommodates these masses via Yukawa couplings but does not *predict* them.

## 2. UET Solution: Generational Information Scaling
UET treats particle generations as topological resonances of the vacuum.
- **Generation Index ($n$)**: Determines the information content of the particle.
- **Mass Scaling**: Mass $M \propto \Phi^n$, where $\Phi$ is a topological constant related to the Golden Ration or field winding number.
- **Top Quark**: Represents the maximal information saturation ($I_{sat}$) of a single fermion node.

## 3. Results Analysis

### Mass Scaling

*Fig 1: Quark Masses vs Generation. The UET fit (Red Line) demonstrates a consistent log-linear scaling, identifying the generations as discrete information octaves.*

## 4. Conclusion
Quark masses are not random constants but eigenstates of a unified Information Field equation. The top quark is "heavy" because it carries the maximum allowable information bit-depth for a fermion.
