# Study A: Nuclear Binding Energy (Recoil Trapping)
**Method**: UET Mass-information Equivalence
**Status**: Partial Pass (Mixed)

### 1. Abstract
Nuclear binding involves "Mass Defect" ($\Delta m$). UET interprets this lost mass not as energy release, but as "Recoil Trapping" efficiency gained by shared addressing.

### 2. Methodology
*   **Assumption**: Nucleons share a "Volume Address".
*   **Prediction**: $M_{nucleus} < \sum M_{proton}$.
*   **Calculation**: We calculate the "Saved Mass" based on geometric overlap.

### 3. Results
*   **Heavy Nuclei**: Good fit.
*   **Light Nuclei**: Deviations observed.
*   **Interpretation**: The "Strong Force" is the vacuum pressure holding the shared address together.

### 4. Conclusion
Binding Energy is "Efficiency Gained".
