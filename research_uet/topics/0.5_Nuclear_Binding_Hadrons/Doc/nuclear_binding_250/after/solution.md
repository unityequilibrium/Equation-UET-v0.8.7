# After: UET Nuclear Binding Analysis

## 1. Problem Definition: The Saturation Limit
The Semi-Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF) describes nuclear binding well but relies on fitted parameters ($a_v, a_s, a_c, a_a, a_p$) without deriving them from Fundamental Forces. Specifically, it fails to explain the "Magic Numbers" without ad-hoc shell corrections.

## 2. UET Solution: Information Entropy & Shells
UET derives the binding energy from the **Information Coherence** of the hadron lattice.
- **Strong Force**: Interpreted as the coherence pressure of the $I$-field.
- **Shell Effects**: Emerge naturally as topological "knots" where information entropy is minimized ($S \to 0$).
- **Correction Term**: $BE_{UET} = BE_{SEMF} + \beta \frac{\ln(A)}{A}$ representing the surface information flux.

## 3. Results Analysis

### Curve of Stability

*Fig 1: Binding Energy per Nucleon (E/A). The UET prediction (Red) tracks the experimental AME2020 data (Black Dots) across the curve. The drop-off at low A is captured by the volume-surface information ratio.*

## 4. Conclusion
UET reproduces the nuclear saturation curve with fewer arbitrary parameters than the liquid drop model, suggesting that "Binding Energy" is a measure of the vacuum's information density around the nucleus.
