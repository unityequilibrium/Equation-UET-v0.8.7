# Topic 0.5: Nuclear Binding & Hadron Structure
**UET Interpretation**: The Strong Force as Vacuum Pressure

### 1. Title & Abstract
**Title**: The Geometric Origin of Nuclear Binding
**Abstract**:
We reinterpret the Strong Nuclear Force as "Information Address Sharing". When nucleons merge, they share spatial addresses, reducing the total update cost. The "Mass Defect" represents this gained efficiency.

### 2. Introduction
Why do protons stick? UET: To save bandwidth.

### 3. Results
**3.1 Study A: Binding Energy**
*   **Finding**: Mass Defect predicted by overlap geometry.

**3.2 Study B: Proton Radius**
*   **Finding**: The "Radius Puzzle" suggests the proton's information surface varies with probe energy ("Resolution").

**3.3 Study C: Quark Masses**
*   **Finding**: Quarks appear heavy/light depending on Recoil Context.

### 4. Conclusion
The nucleus is a "Compressed Archive" of nucleons.
