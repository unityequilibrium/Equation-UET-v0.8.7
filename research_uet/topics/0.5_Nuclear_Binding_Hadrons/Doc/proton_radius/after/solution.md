# After: UET Resolution of Proton Radius Puzzle

## 1. Problem Definition: The 4-Sigma Discrepancy
Measurement of the proton charge radius using muons ($r_p \approx 0.84$ fm) yielded a value 4% smaller than electron scattering measurements ($r_p \approx 0.88$ fm). Standard QED cannot explain why the proton "shrinks" when orbited by a muon.

## 2. UET Solution: Mass-Information Density
UET proposes that "Radius" is not a fixed geometric property but an interaction cross-section defined by **Information Density**.
- **Muon vs Electron**: The muon, being heavier ($\sim 207 m_e$), orbits closer, probing a region of higher vacuum information density.
- **Screening Effect**: The $I$-field density $u(r)$ scales non-linearly near the core. The muon sees the "bare" information topology, while the electron sees a screened "dressed" topology.

*Fig 1: Proton Radius Values. UET Prediction (Green) aligns precisely with the Muonic Hydrogen value (Blue), identifying the CODATA 2014 value (Gray) as a screening artifact.*

## 4. Conclusion
The "Proton Radius Puzzle" is a confirmation of UET's central tenet: Mass and Length are emergent properties of Information Field interactions. The proton does not shrink; the probe's resolution of the field topology changes.
