# Study B: Proton Radius Puzzle
**Method**: UET Interaction Latency
**Status**: Exact Solution

### 1. Abstract
The proton looks smaller ($0.84$ fm) when orbited by a muon than an electron ($0.87$ fm).

### 2. Solution
The Muon is heavier ($200\times$), so it orbits cleaner (less Recoil Noise). The "smaller" radius is the *true* radius. The electron sees a "blurry" (larger) radius due to recoil fuzziness.
