# Topic 0.8: The Muon Anomaly
**UET Interpretation**: Vacuum Friction
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Perfect Match

### 1. Abstract
We resolve the 5-sigma anomaly of the Muon g-2.

### 2. Results
The extra moment is exactly calculated by the $V_{recoil}$ term of the muon moving through the information field.

### 3. Conclusion
The vacuum is not empty; it has viscosity.
