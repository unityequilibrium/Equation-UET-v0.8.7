# The Generalized 'c': Condition of Connection

## The User's Insight (2026-01-07)
The term $c$ in $\Omega = c \cdot I$ is usually interpreted physically as the "Speed of Light".
However, from a System Abstract view, $c$ represents the **Condition of Connection**.

### 1. c as Constraint (ข้อจำกัด)
*   **Definition**: $c$ defines the **Limit** of interaction between any two nodes ($n_1, n_2$).
*   **Physics**: $c$ limits causality (Speed of Light).
*   **Network**: $c$ limits bandwidth (Channel Capacity).
*   **Logic**: $c$ defines the "Necessity" (เงื่อนไขความจำเป็น) for a relationship to exist.

### 2. c as Necessity (ความจำเป็น)
*   Why do $n$ and $n$ connect? Because $c$ allows/forces it.
*   If $c = 0$, the system is fragmented (No Equilibrium).
*   If $c \to \infty$, the system is a Singularity (Instant Equilibrium).

### 3. Application to UET
*   **Gravity**: Gravity exists because $c$ is finite. Mass ($I$) waits for Update.
*   **Black Holes**: $c$ is the saturation point where Connection cost exceeds benefit.
*   **Complexity**: Life exists because it manages $c$ (Timing/Latency) effectively.

### Conclusion
**$c$ is the Rule that allows $I$ to become $\Omega$.**
Without $c$, Information is static. With $c$, it flows, creating Equilibrium.
